# Practical-Language-Processing
Customer Service Center - Dashboard and Chatbot: Masters of Technology in Artificial Intelligence (National University of Singapore - ISS) Practice Module 4

<b>Proposal Pending approval by Dr Fan ZhenZhen</b>

<b><i>Draft Proposal below</b></i><br>
<h1>Overview</h1>

The client is a 24 by 7 call centre for a bank that has customer service officers and a chatbot to handle customer queries for corporate and retail consumers. They have noticed an increasing trend of negative feedback on their customer service in social media over the last few months. Hence, they would like to try using Practical Language Processing (PLP) techniques to augment their existing reporting methodology.

The objectives of this project are to use PLP on the bank dialog dataset to:
-	Assess overall customer satisfaction levels across different service channels and customer segments
-	Identify areas of excellence and areas needing improvement in customer service
-	Detect emerging trends and potential issues in customer needs and expectations
-	Provide actionable insights to maintain and enhance customer service ratings in a dashboard. Real-time data feed into the dashboard is not in scope for this project.
-	Optional: The Dashboard supports a text and speech conversational user interface

And measured using these Performance Metrics
-	Customer Sentiment
  - Overall
  - By Product and Service
  - By Channel
-	Was Intent Achieved
-	Number of Turns taken to achieve intent

By implementing this comprehensive NLP and NLU-based analysis system, the bank will be able to use a data-driven approach to gain deep insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and proactively address emerging trends and adapt quickly to changing customer needs and expectations.

Notes: The client is fictitious, but this is a realistic use case for a bankâ€™s call centre and the dataset used is specific to the banking domain.
